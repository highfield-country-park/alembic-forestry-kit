As well as holding regular events, the Friends of Highfield Park host regular events where we clean up and maintain our park.  No experience or tools required as we have them all on site but be sure to dress for all weathers.

Our next volunteer day is Tuesday 30th July at 10:30am for 1-2 hours and we meet at the main picnic area in the park.
