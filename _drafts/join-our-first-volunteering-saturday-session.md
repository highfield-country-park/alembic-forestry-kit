We are running our first Saturday session in 2019 for volunteers on 23rd March, to work on the forest school area. The work will involve putting down wood chip, putting out some stumps for sitting on, and generally making it look nice! Tools will be provided, but if you have gloves and tools of your own, feel free to bring them. Make sure to wear boots and study clothes!
