Hello, my name is Alex. I set up this website when I lived on Bowler St a few years ago, because Highfield Country Park really made a difference for me. I love the small paths that mean you can wander around, always discovering things and even getting lost sometimes!

I have moved down to Eastbourne now and so I cannot really keep this website updated. I hope someone else will eventually take over posting content on here! Its really easy to make new posts and pages. I can provide a little guide to help you get started with making posts. If you are interested in helping add more blog posts on this site, you can message me on [Facebook]( "https://www.facebook.com/alexanansi") or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/alexeel4).

Thanks for reading!

Alex
