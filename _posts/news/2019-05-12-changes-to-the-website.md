You may not realise, but a lot of things have changed behind the scenes of this website!



I created this website to promote a lovely but underappreciated park, which I think is my favourite park in Manchester. I love the absence of any over-zealous control, here is a place where nature is somewhat able to take its own course. However, I think it is undervalued even within Levenshulme, and so I thought a website would help to promote how great it is. Sadly, I will be leaving Levenshulme in Autumn, but excitingly I will be starting a PhD in Brighton. I will be looking at [rewilding](https://www.rewildingbritain.org.uk/) - and how we can understand cultural barriers to reintroducing wild spaces in Britain.

So in the last few weeks I have been working behind the scenes to allow other people to edit this website. For anyone who is passionate about the park, there is a way to login and add posts and pictures - if you are interested, get in touch with Alec or Jane at the Friends of Highfield Country Park - [see the about page for details](/about).

I have also been running the Twitter account, I enjoyed having fun being a park, in fact, its much more fun that being a person on Twitter as parks don't understand all this political stuff going on. Being a park on Twitter means you can ignore all that stuff and just look at pictures of trees and birds and fungi and stuff. There is a vacancy in managing the Twitter account if anyone is interested...

I hope since I have been involved with the park that more people are aware of it. I have helped to support Claire's mindfulness sessions, which have introduced more people to the wildlife and to the benefits of being in nature, as well as helping promote Jane and Hayley's forest schools. Hopefully in the future, more people will put on events. This website is here to help promote events, news and passion for the park so please keep on using this site after I am gone!

\- Alex
