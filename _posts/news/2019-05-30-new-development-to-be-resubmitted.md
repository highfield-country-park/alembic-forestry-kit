The new development on Cringle Road, for 57 houses, was rejected last year. Earlier in 2018 it was rejected on appeal by the planning inspectorate. However, it appears that the only outstanding objection is for the developers to contribute to the improvement of the park. The developers have notified the Friends group that they are preparing to submit another application. If you want to be notified when this application is actually submitted, so you can register your opinion on this development, you can fill out the form below.
