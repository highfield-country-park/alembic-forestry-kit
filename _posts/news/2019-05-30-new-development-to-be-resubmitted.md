The new development on Cringle Road, for 57 houses, was rejected last year. Earlier in 2018 it was rejected on appeal by the planning inspectorate. However, it appears that the only outstanding objection is for the developers to contribute to the improvement of the park. The developers have notified the Friends group that they are preparing to submit another application. Officially, the Friends group do not support the application, nor do we oppose it. However, in  a personal capacity members of the group have strong opinions on the matter.
