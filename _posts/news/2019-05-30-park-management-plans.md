At the last couple of Friends group meetings, we have been making initial discussions about having a management plan for the park. This would help with applying for funding for the park in general as well as for specific projects. It will hopefully also reduce the amount of damage done by contractors that the council gets to come onto the park for works. If you want to be involved in writing this plan, come along to the meetings or email janesebire@yahoo.co.uk to let you know.
