The local council has unanimously rejected the proposal by Towerhouse Systems to build 57 new houses off Cringle Road again. The local community were well organised in opposing this development, with many objections filed over issues of air pollution, traffic at the junction between Stockport Road and Cringle Road, flawed ecology reports, loss of amenities, and loss of character to the neighbourhood. Although  the Friends of Highfield Country Park group offically took no position on the development, some members of the group have been supporting the local community in opposing it. You can watch the council discussing the development at the [council website](https://manchester.public-i.tv/core/portal/webcast_interactive/423060?fbclid=IwAR02NZ1XS0mrC_3vg5o3J62qm8y16rTdADwDoJQFvtTtOpCuivkZxwKJIQ8) - click the Cringle Road link on the right hand side (this section is 13 minutes long). Towerhouse Systems can still appeal this decision.
