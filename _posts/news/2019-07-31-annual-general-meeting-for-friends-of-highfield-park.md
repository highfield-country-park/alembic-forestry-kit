Would you like more of a say on what goes on in your park?  Would you like to help a team of volunteers who meet regularly to take care of our beautiful nature reserve?  All are welcome at Friends of Highfield Country Park meetings which are held on the third Tuesday of the month every two months.

Our next meeting will be on **Tuesday 17th September** at **7pm** in **Levenshulme Baptist Church**  on Elmsworth Avenue.

In the AGM meeting we elect a committee for the new year and we have a summary of the group's finances.  We will also discuss how we can improve and look after the park.
