        "excerpt": "On Monday 4th September 2018, a small group of us met at Bowler St entrance to the park do an hour of mindfulness with Claire from Wild Awake Mindfulness, and I was attending my first session of outdoor mindfulness in the park. We walked down the little path into the woods. After introducing ourselves, Claire did a couple of short sitting meditations. I noticed that meditating on breath was much easier than indoors alone, and more relaxing than group sessions indoors. The sounds from the park such as birdsong and wind in the trees, the feel of the wind on skin, and simply being in the open air made it much easier to focus on the moment. Even when there were distractions, such as laughter from the picnic areas and noisy crows crying harshly above, it didn’t distract us. We also did some lying meditation, and saw a different side to the woods, watching squirrels and birds hopping about in the trees before closing our eyes. By the time we had finished, it was getting dark, and I felt good to have really felt the passage from day to night. There are some more sessions happening over the next few weeks, see the event below for details!\n\n",

        "content": "You may not realise, but a lot of things have changed behind the scenes of this website!\n\nI created this website to promote a lovely but underappreciated park, which I think is my favourite park in Manchester. I love the absence of any over-zealous control, here is a place where nature is somewhat able to take its own course. However, I think it is undervalued even within Levenshulme, and so I thought a website would help to promote how great it is. Sadly, I will be leaving Levenshulme in Autumn, but excitingly I will be starting a PhD in Brighton. I will be looking at rewilding - and how we can understand cultural barriers to reintroducing wild spaces in Britain.\n\nSo in the last few weeks I have been working behind the scenes to allow other people to edit this website. For anyone who is passionate about the park, there is a way to login and add posts and pictures - if you are interested, get in touch with Alec or Jane at the Friends of Highfield Country Park - see the about page for details.\n\nI have also been running the Twitter account, I enjoyed having fun being a park, in fact, its much more fun that being a person on Twitter as parks don’t understand all this political stuff going on. Being a park on Twitter means you can ignore all that stuff and just look at pictures of trees and birds and fungi and stuff. There is a vacancy in managing the Twitter account if anyone is interested…\n\nI hope since I have been involved with the park that more people are aware of it. I have helped to support Claire’s mindfulness sessions, which have introduced more people to the wildlife and to the benefits of being in nature, as well as helping promote Jane and Hayley’s forest schools. Hopefully in the future, more people will put on events. This website is here to help promote events, news and passion for the park so please keep on using this site after I am gone!\n\n- Alex\n",

Lets learn to play again.\n\nWe will be playing lots of fun games, meditating around a fire, singing campfire songs and drinking mugs of hot chocolate.

    "content": "Highfield Country Park is a 70-acre (280,000 m2) area of open land, situated on the east side of Levenshulme, Manchester, that stretches to the east of Broom Avenue across to the rear of Reddish Golf Course and to the junction of Longford Road, Reddish and Nelstrop Road, Levenshulme.\n\nPrior to 2004, the park was jointly maintained by Manchester City Council and a group of volunteers called The Friends of Highfield Park. In July 2004 the park came to the attention of the Prudential Grass Roots campaign (run by the BTCV conservation charity). Over a 12-month period the park was transformed from a dreary, vandalised wasteland into a country park with a picnic area and mapped out country walks.\n\nIn 2008 Highfield Country Park was designated a Local Nature Reserve, providing a protected habitat for many animal and plant species.\n\nOur current Chair is Alex - aleccowan@hotmail.co.uk\n\nOur current secretary is Jane - janesebire@yahoo.co.uk\n\nHistory\n\nThe land was used to extract clay for the manufacture of bricks for the building industry. The clay pit and brickworks existed at the start of the 20th century, and by the 1950s was being operated by the Jackson Brick Company.\n\nIn the 1970s, it was designated as a country park by the council, but at the time it was little more than a landfill site and sometime site of the UCP tripe factory, Levenshulme Dye and Bleach works, High Field Farm, and Jackson’s brickworks. The latter’s clay pit was much used by local children as a play area known as “The Brickie”.\n\nThe main road between Manchester and Stockport used to travel right next to the park, down Nelstrop Road. This road is hundreds of years old now.\n\nUntil recently, people used to live on the site of Highfield Country Park. However, the house on Nelstrop Road eventually was left abandoned, and was damaged by vandals that meant it had to be torn down for safety reasons.\n\nIn 2017, plans for redeveloping an area of Highfield Country Park were passed by Manchester Council. Friends of Highfield Country Park objected to this decision but were overruled.\n\nWatch a lovely video recording of the park in Summer 2018:\n\n\n",

Although it is does not seem too large, if you take one of the many small paths you may suddenly find yourself wondering whether you are still in Manchester... in much of it, you can only see the trees and long grass.
