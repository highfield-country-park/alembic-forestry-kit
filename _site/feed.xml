I want to invite you to have &lt;strong&gt;fun&lt;/strong&gt; (mindfully of course).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An opportunity for you to bring out your inner child and have some fun by immersing yourself in nature, play and mindfulness. Play isn’t just for kids, it increases our sense of feeling good about ourselves and can help us to feel more connected with others, we drop our usual roles (mother, father, carer, friend, boss, colleague) and ‘just be’ as kids do so easily. We are all kids at heart- we have just forgotten how to be. &lt;strong&gt;Lets learn to play again.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will be playing lots of fun games, meditating around a fire, singing campfire songs and drinking mugs of hot chocolate. No prior mindfulness or playfulness experience needed. &lt;strong&gt;Tickets are £25 and LIMITED to 14 places so book quickly to secure your place&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wildawake-mindfulness.co.uk/what-s-on&quot; title=&quot;https://www.wildawake-mindfulness.co.uk/what-s-on&quot;&gt;https://www.wildawake-mindfulness.co.uk/what-s-on&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">It appears I have turned into a big kid and with as much big kid enthusiasm as I can muster (and I can muster quite a lot I am so excited!)

&lt;p&gt;I created this website to promote a lovely but underappreciated park, which I think is my favourite park in Manchester. I love the absence of any over-zealous control, here is a place where nature is somewhat able to take its own course. However, I think it is undervalued even within Levenshulme, and so I thought a website would help to promote how great it is. Sadly, I will be leaving Levenshulme in Autumn, but excitingly I will be starting a PhD in Brighton. I will be looking at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.rewildingbritain.org.uk/&quot;&gt;rewilding&lt;/a&gt; - and how we can understand cultural barriers to reintroducing wild spaces in Britain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So in the last few weeks I have been working behind the scenes to allow other people to edit this website. For anyone who is passionate about the park, there is a way to login and add posts and pictures - if you are interested, get in touch with Alec or Jane at the Friends of Highfield Country Park - &lt;a href=&quot;/about&quot;&gt;see the about page for details&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have also been running the Twitter account, I enjoyed having fun being a park, in fact, its much more fun that being a person on Twitter as parks don’t understand all this political stuff going on. Being a park on Twitter means you can ignore all that stuff and just look at pictures of trees and birds and fungi and stuff. There is a vacancy in managing the Twitter account if anyone is interested…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope since I have been involved with the park that more people are aware of it. I have helped to support Claire’s mindfulness sessions, which have introduced more people to the wildlife and to the benefits of being in nature, as well as helping promote Jane and Hayley’s forest schools. Hopefully in the future, more people will put on events. This website is here to help promote events, news and passion for the park so please keep on using this site after I am gone!&lt;/p&gt;

We walked down the little path into the woods. After introducing ourselves, Claire did a couple of short sitting meditations. I noticed that meditating on breath was much easier than indoors alone, and more relaxing than group sessions indoors. The sounds from the park such as birdsong and wind in the trees, the feel of the wind on skin, and simply being in the open air made it much easier to focus on the moment. Even when there were distractions, such as laughter from the picnic areas and noisy crows crying harshly above, it didn’t distract us. We also did some lying meditation, and saw a different side to the woods, watching squirrels and birds hopping about in the trees before closing our eyes. By the time we had finished, it was getting dark, and I felt good to have really felt the passage from day to night. There are some more sessions happening over the next few weeks, see the event below for details!&lt;/p&gt;
