    <span>- litter picking</span><br/>
    <span>- weeding</span><br/>
    <span>- building bird boxes</span><br/>
    <span>- maintaining the paths</span><br/>
    <span>- writing content for the website</span><br/>
    <span>- helping with social media</span><br/>
    <span>- starting projects and applying for funding </span><br/>
  </p>
