There are lots of ways that you can help:

* bulb planting
* litter picking
* weeding
* building bird boxes
* maintaining the paths
* writing content for the website
* helping with social media
* starting projects
* applying for funding

There are also many admin jobs you can help with, for example, setting up and maintaining a shared files repository (like Google Docs), fundraising, running events, and publicity... so if you have a desire to help then fill in the form below!
